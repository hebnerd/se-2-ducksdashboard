This half of a semester long Software Engineering II project involved creating a dashboard which presented stats gathered from an online pet store. The dashboard was required to have a backend for authenticated users which allowed them to configure what was displayed. It interacted with the other half of the project, which was a REST API that could record and gather the stats. Written entirely in Django.

Requires Python 3.9

Can be run using "/venv/Scripts/activate" 

Followed by "python initial_setup.py"

And then, "python manage.py runserver 127.0.0.1:8000"
